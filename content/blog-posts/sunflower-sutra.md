## Out - Of - Bound

### **Motivation**

These days, users of VR systems are often injured while using these techniques and such cases are not uncommon and arise both for beginners who have tried it for the first time as well as for experienced users. For such reason, VR companies invented _Safety Mechanisms_ to protect their customers. Unfortunately, they did not completely stop the incidents that appeared in process of use. With the members of the DIVA Research group       Jan Gugenheimer and Wen-Jie Tseng, we want to pay attention to this issue. 

Safety mechanisms nowadays are mostly rendered as a grid surrounding the user. For our convenience, we have denoted the term _“breaking out”_ which stands for any attempt to somehow violate the boundaries of the security mechanism, albeit in whole or in part.

Our motivation is to reduce the number of breaking out attempts as well as the number of incidents and accidents caused by the use of virtual reality systems. This could be accomplished by understanding what these new technologies are missing now. So the purpose of our work is to understand how users feel about this safety technique and to analyze how really useful they are.

### A New Blood

["A persons who are accepted into a group or organization and are expected to provide fresh ideas and vitality."](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/new%20blood)

To address the lack of data on the user experience of security technologies, it was decided to conduct its own research. The best option was to organize a survey with the key points that interested us

It was decided to identify the key points and consider the problem in detail, which led us to compile a survey with all the questions that interest us. Like any research activity, my work began with testing the water. This is a crushing moment when designing any survey and working with participants because you need to know the crowd being interviewed and have an idea of the topic of the survey. Which for me was an introduction to the world of virtual reality. I did my research and got acquainted with companies that provide virtual reality headsets, especially those that have a safety system. I had a chance to try the Oculus Quest 1 headset live and evaluate the work of their Guardian security system. As well as learning about the concept of headsets, I needed to understand what problems they cause. I was helped by reading scientific articles about this, as well as watching various video compilations of VR fail and going through Reddit and Facebook VR groups. This was the lead-off stage of the process.

The only water on the river mirrored the red sky, sun sank on top of final Frisco peaks, no fish in that stream, no hermit in those mounts, just ourselves rheumy-eyed and hung-over like old bums on the riverbank, tired and wily.

Look at the Sunflower, he said, there was a dead gray shadow against the sky, big as a man, sitting dry on top of a pile of ancient sawdust--

\--I rushed up enchanted--it was my first sunflower, memories of Blake--my visions--Harlem

# "the gray Sunflower poised against the sunset, crackly bleak and dusty with the smut and smog and smoke of olden locomotives in its eye"

and Hells of the Eastern rivers, bridges clanking Joes greasy Sandwiches, dead baby carriages, black treadless tires forgotten and unretreaded, the poem of the riverbank, condoms & pots, steel knives, nothing stainless, only the dank muck and the razor-sharp artifacts passing into the past--

and the gray Sunflower poised against the sunset, crackly bleak and dusty with the smut and smog and smoke of olden locomotives in its eye--

corolla of bleary spikes pushed down and broken like a battered crown, seeds fallen out of its face, soon-to-be-toothless mouth of sunny air, sunrays obliterated on its hairy head like a dried wire spiderweb,

leaves stuck out like arms out of the stem, gestures from the sawdust root, broke pieces of plaster fallen out of the black twigs, a dead fly in its ear,

Unholy battered old thing you were, my sunflower O my soul, I loved you then!

The grime was no man's grime but death and human locomotives,

all that dress of dust, that veil of darkened railroad skin, that smog of cheek, that eyelid of black mis'ry, that sooty hand or phallus or protuberance of artificial worse-than-dirt--industrial--modern--all that civilization spotting your crazy golden crown--

and those blear thoughts of death and dusty loveless eyes and ends and withered roots below, in the home-pile of sand and sawdust, rubber dollar bills, skin of machinery, the guts and innards of the weeping coughing car, the empty lonely tincans with their rusty tongues alack, what more could I name, the smoked ashes of some cock cigar, the cunts of wheelbarrows and the milky breasts of cars, wornout asses out of chairs & sphincters of dynamos--all these

entangled in your mummied roots--and you standing before me in the sunset, all your glory in your form!

A perfect beauty of a sunflower! a perfect excellent lovely sunflower existence! a sweet natural eye to the new hip moon, woke up alive and excited grasping in the sunset shadow sunrise golden monthly breeze!
