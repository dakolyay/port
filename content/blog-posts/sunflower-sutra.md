### **Motivation**

Virtual reality is progressive technology these days. Thanks to them, we discovered a new type of interaction with information by the creation of a simulated environment. They open doors to new ideas and opportunities and their use is slowly becoming part of the routine of everyday life. But as exciting as they are, the experience[\[1\]](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3411764.3445435) has shown that we are not fully prepared to use them safely. Users are often injured while using these techniques and such cases are not uncommon and arise both for beginners who have tried it for the first time as well as for experienced users. This is such a frequent occurrence that it deserves the term “_VR fail_”. Based on this, the companies of VR systems presented various techniques whose main goal was to keep the user safe as it was named _safety mechanisms_ (SM). Safety mechanisms nowadays are mostly rendered as a grid surrounding the user whose boundaries signal if the user is too close to them or if the user contacts with the border. For our convenience, any effort to somehow violate the boundaries of the SF, albeit in whole or in part we have denoted as “_breaking out_”.

Our motivation is to reduce the number of breaking out attempts as well as the number of incidents and accidents caused by the use of virtual reality systems. This could be accomplished by understanding what these new technologies are missing now. So the purpose of our work is to understand how users feel about this safety technique and to analyze how really useful they are.

### **Problem**

### **Method**

It was decided to identify the key points and consider the problem in detail. However, the lack of information according to safety mechanisms as well as the information about users experiences with them in VR led us to run our own survey. We conducted an online experiment(N=62) that investigates respondents’ behaviour inside safety boundaries and during _the_ _breaking out_ process along with what were the border settings at that time. We focused on the public, which should be actively using VR headsets with inbuilt SM. The survey was created on[ Google Forms](https://www.google.com/forms/about/) for the reason of its clarity and convenience. Due to multiple iterations which were done in order to get an optimal version of the survey - two surveys were compiled. However, only open-ended questions of the pilot survey will be considered. The pilot survey was published on different platforms such as Reddit, [XRDRN](https://www.xrdrn.org/about/), also between [the DIVA research group](https://diva.telecom-paristech.fr) members. The second survey was posted on Amazon MTurk. The ameliorated survey covers demographic questions, questions about how participants act in VR also what brought them to act like that, plus personal feedback:

1. **Demographics**(n=10).
2. **Set up Safety Boundaries**(n=13). Questions asked was related to default settings and their modification together with customization of safety mechanism.
   * General setting up(n=8)
   * Customizing the VR safety boundaries(n=2)
   * Modify safety boundaries' default settings(n=3)
3. **While using VR**(n=22):
   * Attitude towards safety mechanism(n=9). This section has two 5-point scale questions about the frequency of notification and any kind of violation of safety boundaries, seven 5-point Likert scale questions ("strongly disagree" - "strongly agree") about safety mechanisms' performance from participants view.
   * Triggering the safety boundary(n=4). Questions of this section relate to how participants triggered safety boundaries warnings and what was their actions after it.
   * When breaking out happens(n=6). We are interested to know did triggering boundaries of SF led to _breaking out_ experience. If it was a case, what was the overall situation and what were the reasons and settings during it?
   * Inside the safety boundary(n=3). On the contrary, If there were not any _breaking out_ experiences, we are curious to know what made participants stay inside safety boundaries.
4. **Personal feedback on the VR safety boundaries**(n=3).

As a result, we received 14 answers from the pilot survey and 48 answers from Amazon MTurk.

_Demographics:_  
As mentioned above our research concerned only a special narrow circle of society. We examined people who actively used virtual reality technologies, thereby claiming that they have sufficient experience to properly answer the questions.

The results are based on respondents, who completed the MTurk survey. 59% of the respondents were male. The respondents ranged in age from 20 to 63, with an average age of 32 (standard deviation 9.1). Among 48 participants, 73% declare themselves as Gamers(35), 17% as Developers(8) and 10% as Designers(5). The majority held a Bachelor's degree(56%).

The proficiency of users was counted in months, therefore participants have on average a bit less than 2 years (21 months) of frequent user experience. The "newbies" are considered as frequent users only since June(2 months) when the "skilled" is in VR 5 years already(62 months).

According to the survey's result [ Oculus Quest 2](https://www.oculus.com/quest-2/) is the most used VR headset (31%) followed by  [Oculus Rift](https://www.oculus.com) (27%) and [Oculus Quest 1](https://www.oculus.com/quest/features/) (16%) that respondents chose as the device they are more familiar with and besides, they turned out to be the most sold among the audience (16 customers of Oculus Quest 2 and Oculus Rift & 15 of Oculus Quest 1).

Generally, the respondents used a VR headset 10.6 hours per week (1,77 per day) in the range from 1 to 30 hours per week. The majority spend this time equally between standing and sitting positions (27%). Participants did not show any preference in the type of VR setting (room-scale, stationary) which they set with proportion 50/50 of all the time spent in VR.

_Set up Safety Boundaries_

We ask people how frequently they reset their safety boundaries and what is the reason to do so. The minority agreed that either they never change settings, or every time they reset boundaries when launching VR. The rest reported that they do reset boundaries occasionally, from time to time. The particular reasons for it are (1) a request from VR systems (52%) and (2) a change of the usual or last environment situation (43%). For these two reasons, we can say that users have to reconfigure their safety boundaries to start using VR headsets, and in most cases, their system forces them to do this.

A third of the respondents follow the instructions by removing all obstacles from within borders.

Almost no one ever turned off SM (2 participants)  but 22% have tried to change SMs' default settings. When asking what was the default setting they rather change, the majority agreed on "**Increase proximity sensitivity**", "**Grid appearance (floor and wall displayed)**". One of the reasons provided for change safety boundaries' appearance is:

> I made the colors more noticeable and bright. I was careless in the beginning and I fell down stepping on a floor mat and my headset has got some cracks. It was a lucky day for me that I could escape with no injuries. So I was extra careful since then

_While using VR_

Attitude towards SM

After triggering the safety boundaries warning the 40% of respondents have left the safety area even if almost all of them (90%) have been warned about violating safety boundaries. The most common reason was the incompatibility of physical movements, hand motor skills and maintaining the body balance between virtuality and reality.

  
During the breaking out, the most common application type was Gaming(90%) and in the list of applications, the dominant part is adventure shooter videogames (Half-Life: Alyx, Minecraft, Jurassic world, Zombie shooter, Gorn, Saber Fight VR, The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR, Star Trek: Bridge Crew, Superhot VR, Vader Immortal: Episode I et cetera). All these games involve continuous movement and are action-heavy. During the use of these applications, users have to strike a balance between two realities. 

Participants who have not broken out from safety boundaries mostly triggered it with **"Breaking out of the boundary with the controller (or hand)"** and **"Approximating the boundary but not breaking out"**. Сuriously enough in most cases, they do stop their actions during VR if participants are too close to boundaries or made it show up because of the controller.

_Feedback_

To understand what is the first thing that comes to people’s minds according to safety mechanisms, we asked them to give three positives and negatives. Then we coded them into a word cloud. The word cloud is one way to visualize text and its constituent words. After preprocessing and preparing the text for the cloud developing words are listed by their importance. The more often the word appears in the text the bigger and more noticeable it will be designed on the plot.

The most common positive association with safety mechanisms will be "safe(safety)" that appears 20 times followed by "helpful" (4) and "reliable"(4). The most popular pair of two positive qualities are "safe" and "easy".

  
And the most frequent negative impression will be **annoying**.   For negative signs are risky and unproductive.

This actively demonstrates that the safety mechanism does its work correctly and users do not complain about technical shortcomings, but about the format of the implementation of these techniques.

### **What we learned:(Conclusion)**

* The more user has to perform physical actions the higher the probability of breaking out.
* Although most users rarely notice boundaries and just as rarely violate them, they immediately rethink their actions and stop after triggered boundaries appear. This is what the third observation can tell us.
* For the user, the biggest drawback is not in the technical form of implementation, but in how this form irritates them. This means that it is worth choosing a different way of forewarning users than today's multi-coloured grids.
* Since more people find SM annoying they easily neglect them.

### **Future Work**

For future work, it could be useful to recruit more people in order to have more practical information. As an idea, further experiments could be arranged in real-time in which the participants will have to complete the VR game where they will need to avoid the barriers and obstacles.
