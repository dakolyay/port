In this blog post, I will describe the implementation process of the locomotion technique that I have chosen.

In terms of this course, we(students) have been asked to implement one variation of movement in VR. We have been provided with an environment where we could test our implementation related to different features: time, accuracy, playability, level of cause simulation sickness, fun during usage, and feeling of presence. The environment is called [**Parkour**](https://github.com/wenjietseng/VR-locomotion-parkour) which was provided by Wen-Jie Tseng.

You can find the idea for my locomotion technique [**here**](https://app.forestry.io/sites/l07bwi0ocbq4cw/#/pages/content-blog-posts-vr-locomotion-pitch-md/). In short, it is the avatar of the car model which players can drive and fly with it. It is a car for the future and I call my locomotion technique Teach Me How to Drive. There are two reasons for it: I wanted to teach players how to drive a car from the future to learn it in advance, and palyers can learn how to drive with a regular car.
