In this blog post, I will describe the implementation process of the locomotion technique that I have chosen. 

In terms of this course, we(students) have been asked to implement one variation of movement in VR. We have been provided with an environment where we could test our implementation related to different features: time, accuracy, playability, level of cause simulation sickness, fun during usage, and feeling of presence. The environment is called [**Parkour**](https://github.com/wenjietseng/VR-locomotion-parkour) which was provided by Wen-Jie Tseng.
