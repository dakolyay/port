Unity Hub is a launcher where you can install, update, maintain multiple versions of Unity. We can use it and create our own mobile games and games and more! In this blog post we will see the process of lauching Unity Hub on Mac system.

**Step 1.**

First, we'll load [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download). Unity Hub is a launcher where you can install, update, maintain multiple versions of Unity. By pressing option Unity Hub we will finish the first step.

Allow your browser to download Unity Hub to your machine. If something unclear with picture below, Safari is gently asking me to give permission to download and set the web-site for safe load. By allowing it, the process of downloading the [dmg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Disk_Image "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Disk_Image") file with start.

After successfull downloading you may like to launch the Unity Hub for the first time. In my case, my laptop is clafirying from me my willing to open file which was downloaded from internet.

**Step 3.**

By pressing open button we will, of course, have a window with Unity Terms of Service with all the important rules and terms for better use of Unity.  ![](/images/2022-02-14-16-37-57.png)

Of course we will read everything carefully and decided neither agree or disagree. To go for next step and successfully setup Unity we will have to agree with Terms of Service.

**Step 4.** 

After third step the window with dmg file and Application folder with appear. The installation is pretty easy in this step. All you have to do is to drag and drop Unity Hub icon to Application icon.

After dropping to Application icon, Unity Hub will appear in Application folder and you can find it in Launchpad and Finder. The setting process is almost over! 

If you have done everything well, now you may delete dmg file you have downloaded before because we will not need it anymore.

**Step 5.** 

YAY! Now if you will launch the application you will see this window. This is Welcome window and you will have to either create a new account or sign in. In my case, I already have an account so I will directly sign in. Thankfully your account will be connected to your email address so if you will forget your password, like me, you can always reset it.

**Step 6.**

Soon you will be able to create and work with Unity but you have to intall needed resources. 

_If you will work with Oculus Quest you have to put the check on Android Build Support._ 

Time to time you will have to code, it is already time to accept this. Unity Hub proposes to download Visual Studio as IDE but you can use whatever IDE you want to. You can find out different options[ here](https://www.dunebook.com/best-unity-ide/).

**Step 7.**

Now you can work with projects! You can either create a new project or you can open already existed. You can create 2D, 3D, 3D with extras and other types of projects.
