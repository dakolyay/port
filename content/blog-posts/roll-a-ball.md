There is a really goodly explained tutorial for beginners who just started to work with Unity. It is called [**Roll a Ball**](https://learn.unity.com/project/roll-a-ball) where you will have to create a mini-game with the ball in the closed territory and collect points by hitting the collectibles. 

I found this tutorial quite easy to do and well explained. In this blog post, I will summarize the most important parts of Roll A Ball implementation. 

First of all, we have to create a new project. To do so we launch Unity and press the _New_ button. You can always continue with the existing project by adding it to the projects window in Unity.

For this project, we will choose a 3D project because we would like to have a game in a 3D envirolment.

First thing that we will have to do when we will launch our just created project is to create a scene. There are different ways to do so and this is one of them:

After we will have our scene it will be nice to have some kind of flatness on which we will put our balls and collectibles. It is not complicated and we have to follow the same process:
