My initial idea for the locomotion technique which I wanted to implement was skiing. I got inspired by a mountain skiing walk that practice often in my hometown. As well I got inspiration from the [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9EQ3ZR57O6w) of a Skiing game that I found on YouTube. 

But...

My final idea for the locomotion technique, which I implemented as the final project was not skiing. There were several reasons why I changed my mind. 

1. It was challenging to implement the whole range of movement with the skiing locomotion technique. Because the whole process of movement during skiing is to maintain your legs muscles as well as arm muscles. It did not sound to me right to implement this technique and ignore the leg movement which was crucial in this type of movement. 
2. I found that there is no way to make a 180-degree turn.
3. As well as a person with no experience in Unity I should also keep in mind the complexity of implementation. Working with skiing physics and arranging all the small details to make the technique as real as it should sound really hard.
4. Obligatory arm movement from some degree to some degree which is the main source of your movement during the whole Parkour sound to be really exhausting and did not stick with the view for locomotion technique I wanted to have in the end. 

So I decided to implement a car movement locomotion technique. But to a classing steering wheel controlling car I wanted to implement a flying car of the future that will both have a driving and flying ability. I saw this locomotion technique as avatar movement where you can control your driving car using your controllers.
