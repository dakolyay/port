### **SES215 User-Centered Design**

#### 14.09.2021 Introduction class or "How I meet my profs"

In the first lecture, it is very correct to explain to students what they will face by taking the class, what is required of them and the most important thing is what this class is about and what they are going to be taught throughout the course.

It was not difficult for me to listen to the introductory lecture, and it was enjoyable to listen to the lecturers. The presentation of general class information was quite informative, the slides were visually pleasing and did not hurt the eyes.

The class concept differs from typical classes I used to take in Telecom and L'Ecole Polytechnique. It is also interesting to mention that the students of this class came from different backgrounds and various specialities. As well as the course is original and more sociable kind it is bi-lingual, so more reason to me to practice mon français.

The way the [lecturers](https://synapses.telecom-paris.fr/catalogue/2020-2021/ue/13604/SES215-user-centered-design-user-research) conveyed information made me more motivated and I got a greater interest in this class. They connected information about the concept of designing something with other sciences. Design is abruptly connected with other concepts and probing these concepts can improve the construction of the design as much as possible.

To do this, you need to have creative thinking, knowledge about some historical events, feel the situation, be able to defend your point of view and be able to properly discuss. It is also important to know the correct approach to people since the creation of a design is all directed towards users. Therefore, the centre of the design is the person, and this is the reason for the name of such a course(_"User-centred Design"_).

As much as the information regarding the final product was a little vague, but further discussion of this topic was assumed.

_In general_, the first lecture left only positive emotions and gave an additional impetus to the exploration of the unknown world of design.
