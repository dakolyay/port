### **SES215-SES216 User-Centered Design(Introduction & Prototyping)**

#### 14.09.2021 Introduction class or "How I meet my profs"

In the first lecture, it is very correct to explain to students what they will face by taking the class, what is required of them and the most important thing is what this class is about and what they are going to be taught throughout the course.

It was not difficult for me to listen to the introductory lecture, and it was enjoyable to listen to the lecturers. The presentation of general class information was quite informative, the slides were visually pleasing and did not hurt the eyes.

The class concept differs from typical classes I used to take in Telecom and L'Ecole Polytechnique. It is also interesting to mention that the students of this class came from different backgrounds and various specialities. As well as the course is original and more sociable kind it is bi-lingual, so more reason to me to practice mon français.

The way the [lecturers](https://synapses.telecom-paris.fr/catalogue/2020-2021/ue/13604/SES215-user-centered-design-user-research) conveyed information made me more motivated and I got a greater interest in this class. They connected information about the concept of designing something with other sciences. Design is abruptly connected with other concepts and probing these concepts can improve the construction of the design as much as possible.

To do this, you need to have creative thinking, knowledge about some historical events, feel the situation, be able to defend your point of view and be able to properly discuss. It is also important to know the correct approach to people since the creation of a design is all directed towards users. Therefore, the centre of the design is the person, and this is the reason for the name of such a course(_"User-centred Design"_).

As much as the information regarding the final product was a little vague, but further discussion of this topic was assumed.

_In general_, the first lecture left only positive emotions and gave an additional impetus to the exploration of the unknown world of design.

#### 21.09.2021 Tooth Fairy

After the first lecture, we were asked to read and watch the slides about UX dimensions ourselves. UX helps us to understand and observe behaviour attitude, cognitive attitude and emotional aspects. So we can focus on 7 different dimensions to figure the devise's UX out. It was also necessary to make a UX analysis of any subject that we use and talk about it.

I didn’t think for a long time when it was necessary to choose an item of daily use. My choice immediately fell on headphones. I can't live a day without them. I have developed a bad habit of not getting on vehicles or going for long walks without headphones.

Headphones are a must-have these days. Almost every device now has a headphone jack.

Headphones help us to immerse ourselves in the world and it is also one of the available methods of self-isolation from society. I am an owner of an iPhone this is why I am using headphones "**earpods**" that the company sells with it.

_Utility:_ Thanks to the headphones, we are able to listen to the files we need, such as music, podcasts and audiobooks, and also talk on the phone. They help us to isolate ourselves from society for the best listening and privacy of the call. With headphones, you can play a video game and also have a conversation with your partners. With headphones, we don't need to disturb the public about sounds, because they are purposefully going into your ears. Specifically, with these headphones, they do their job (transmit sound) well, but are quite behind the more advanced headphones.

_Usability:_ These headphones have all the features you need for a basic headphone. It has a panel with buttons for increasing and decreasing the volume of the sound, stopping and playing, as well as switching to the next and previous song. Regarding the connection, there are no serious complications. The headphone head can be inserted into the auricles with no effort. If you are a user with a [lightning plug](https://apple.fandom.com/wiki/Lightning_(connector)) the cord is very easy to connect to the phone. Otherwise, you will have to use a special adapter from the lightning plug to the headphone plug of your phone.

The plus and minus signs can be immediately understood as increasing or decreasing the volume of a sound. But for the rest of the panel's buttons, it is harder to intuitive find the use.

By pressing the **centre button** (C) once we can turn on or off the music. By pressing it twice the next song will be played. After pressing the button three times the previous song you have played will turn on again.

Also, the microphone is very compact and beautifully hidden in the middle of the panel. It is possible to answer the call by pressing the centre button once.

The panel helps to interact with the phone without unblocking it or taking it out from your pocket.

_Security:_ There is no danger or risk that appeared while using this headset. Because of that, there are no feelings from users related to the security of the device.

_Sustainability:_ Unfortunately, Apple uses the tactic of planned material wear and tear on products. These headphones may not last as long as more advanced models. The main wear goes to the connecting parts of the cable and the phone and slight damage to the internal wires by bending the headphones. Most often, you have to transport the headphones in a bent position, which causes such a defect.

_Accessibility:_ Headphones are considered a must-have addition to your techs like a phone or computer. It is easy to use for all members of society. Due to the unpopular type of plug used in these particular headphones, they may not please everyone. But for this, there is already a solution as an adapter or a phone that supports such a connector from the Apple company.

_Trust:_ As with all Apple products, these headphones have an initial level of trust thanks to the company's image. I believe that these headphones inspire confidence in me due to the fact that in case of manufacturing defects, the company will replace them or return compensation to me. As an Apple customer, I can count on proper customer support.

_Pleasure:_ With a pleasant-to-touch cable, the branded white colour of the headphones from the Apple device, the device works without problems and without braking. The minimalistic style is accompanied by the minimalistic terms of use. It looks like it lets us know about itself as a product, about its principle of work.

I found myself quite resourceful when a student in our class chose a toothbrush. Listening to his analysis of the toothbrush and how many thoughts revolve around her is surprising and interesting.

#### 28.09.2021 Me and technologies around me

With each lecture, we come closer to the problem of our project. In this lecture, we explored the initial step for learning interactive design, which is user research and ergonomics.

The manifestation of the virtual world in reality, has revealed that it is not enough for a person to just watch the picture change. Humans, as active and active beings, began to strive to build the virtual world in such a way that this world would match his wildest dreams as best as possible. Technologies have been consistently changing, and today there is a certain set of requirements for both the design and the design of the virtual world. So **interactive design** is a user-centred area of development that focuses on the communication processes that occur through the interaction of people with technology.

From this lecture, I got a clear understanding that interactive design is not only about _interface design_. It is **time**, **movement**, **space**, **appearance**, **texture** and **sound**. Developing an interactive user interface design requires a good understanding of the “context” of working with users. It is the context that determines the list of functions that the information system should have in order to achieve the goals of the project and meet the potential needs of users. User request contexts can be determined by the list of answers to typical questions: “_what the user wants the system to be able to do; how the system will fit into the user's workflow or daily activities; how technically savvy the user is and what similar systems he has already turned to; what style of information display will the user like_".

Thus, interactive design is a process of research and development of the user's concept to the point when it begins to coincide with the capabilities of information technology and the creative intentions of the designer. The main task in such interaction is to understand that “_users choose the sequence and pace of interaction, and most importantly, they decide what to look at and what to ignore_”.

Our team chose to choose the problem of _digital illiteracy_ in a nearby town Orsay. We liked the idea to help people with such a problem, which in the age of advanced technologies takes place for various reasons. Initially, the question was about: _how to help digital illiterate people living in the city get the opportunity to access resources and find decent help for their digital training_.

After thinking about the problem and its potential difficulties, we decided to find a different approach. And we had an idea: _what if we create a platform for people who are already digital literate and are ready to help people and share their knowledge_. Since there are so many possible and available resources, why not address the problem of communication between digital helpers and our users. The target audience for us is also users who have difficulties with technology and digital helpers. **Digital helpers** for us are people who are ready to help their friends, family, neighbours and even people who are unfamiliar to them in order to solve a specific problem or to identify their digital illiteracy degree and work with it. Related to an illiteracy degree, it is not possible to generalize it since it is an individual indicator and it requires individual training.

Since the coin has two sides, we decided that the main responsibility would fall on the assistants. There is the problem of **initial help**. Some digital illiterate people do not have the ability to deal with their problems because a) they do not have the necessary requisites b) the services are already online and they cannot access them because of their digital illiteracy. So we want to meet some potential digital helpers and hear them out.

#### 05.10.2021 Interview, Interview and more Interview

Since problems with digital illiteracy can happen to everyone, we decided to try to conduct an interview with the closest circle of relatives or friends. Unfortunately, we were unable to find suitable people who could be considered our target users. As a target user, we consider people or groups of people who are facing any kind of illiteracy problems. All those whom we considered suitable for interviewing did not want to admit or admit themselves as digital illiterate person. Although their relatives and friends tend to help them from time to time with interaction with the digital world, this is not considered sufficient to refer to yourself as illiterate by the opinion of potential interviewers.

We began to structure the interviews and try to understand which questions are important to us, which ones we would like to ask and which ones we would like to receive answers to. It was difficult to design the questions so that there weren't too many of them. Because we had more and more questions that arise from the previous. We wanted not to be scattered and focus on our key audience and their problems. 

  
We first emailed Theo Lazuech of the CATON organization to see if he knew of anyone we might contact for an interview and observation. Theo provided us with a list of 9 persons and organizations to contact in order to locate participation. We received a response from one of the organizations after sending emails to three of them. We spoke with the director of COPI (1M), a local Orsay-based organization that provides digital training. 

We next spoke with a buddy (1M), a 26-year-old software engineer who assists his technologically illiterate mum with technical challenges on occasion.

We also reached out to Emmaüs-Connect in Créteil about attending one of their "permanences connectées" workshops, where digitally illiterate persons may get technical assistance. Two digitally illiterate and three digital assistant participants willing to be recorded participated in a two-hour permanence connectée session. Participants who were digitally illiterate (2F) were middle-aged women with varying levels of digital literacy. Woman 1 is a complete novice when it comes to technology, thus she relied on at least one digital assistant during the session. Woman 2 is a technology intermediate; she was left alone to complete her workouts and asked assistance from digital assistants as needed. The three digital assistant participants (2F, 1M) have varying levels of expertise in assisting others. Helper 1 (1F) had some prior experience assisting digitally illiterate individuals, Helper 2 (1F) had no prior experience assisting digitally illiterate individuals, and Helper 3 (1M) had substantial prior experience assisting digitally illiterate individuals.

Then we start to frame the interview grid.

For a better understanding of the problem, we turned out to be quite lucky and managed to conduct two interviews. 

The two interviews were auto-transcribed and reviewed by two people in order to find and emphasize any key points. This information, along with some handwritten notes collected during the interview, is then grouped by themes addressed to establish three to four primary categories of subjects to investigate.

With that as well we did an observation session. One person observes the session, records it on camera, and makes notes. The notes are modified at the conclusion of the observation through an exit interview and after the observation through a video review. Based on the raw notes from the observation, an analysis of the resources utilized throughout the session was undertaken to highlight crucial aspects about the resources being used and how digital helpers discover these resources.

#### 19.10.2021

For the next two weeks, we were busy studying the data obtained from the interviews and observation. We made some interesting conclusions that are very important in the creation of the subsequent prototype. **First of all**, we found that some people are digital illiterate due to a lack or lack of proper equipment. This does not allow them to practice enough to become more literate in technology use. **Later**, we have made sure that there is a certain score in a person's digital illiteracy. We realized that this is both a plus and a minus for us. Plus, because if we will find the right approach, we can systematize the problem and find the best solution for it. So it will turn out to do group lessons on digital illiteracy if people in this group are on the same level in digital illiteracy.

interpretation and categories of people and resources

#### 02.11.2021

This week, the team and I completely got involved in writing a report and preparing our slides for the next week. We decided to name our project "DIOD" which stands for Digital Illiteracy Online Diagnosis. We tried to be pretty short and clear and paid close attention to detail. By following **the report template**, of course. 

#### 09.11.2021 That's all folks!

On the last day of our class, we had to look at the presentations of other groups and also present the work already done.

Our presentation covered all the most important topics, such as problem selection and consecration of the problem, analysis of an approximate prototype, strengthening knowledge through interviews and various resources, correcting the prototype, reinforcing knowledge and bringing out the final list of signs that we would like to embody in our product.

Corrections and comments from the jury were made. We were asked to look at and think about the problem of analyzing and calculating the level of illiteracy because such a level cannot be divided into categories and it is rather difficult to assess literacy since this is an individual quality of each future user.

In the future, I hope we will get more of the functionality we offer.

Unfortunately, I didn’t get to hear presentations from other groups because of my health conditions.

#### 23.11.2021 Introduction class or "How I meet my profs" 2.0

This was the beginning of the second part of this course. The new course SES216 is a continuation of the previous course SES215, but now we will deepen and sharpen the focus on prototypes, how to make them, and what is important during prototyping. At the end of this course, we will have to provide a prototype for our design solution to the problem of local illiteracy. After some administrative designations for new students (it is a very good idea to allow adding students who did not participate in the last course), we started the lecture.

The lecture was quite interesting. I think the beginning of a course should always start with historical facts. After the historical intro, you can get acquainted with the subject of your studies and understand in what state this or that science was and in what state it is now. But there was something different about this lecture that made this lecture different from others.  We were told about people whose names should be mentioned when we talk about interactive design. But what is interactive design and why do we designate one area for design and interactivity?

**Interactive design** is the way the user interacts with the content. The interactive design has a strong impact on perception. This process is carried out thanks to the preliminary analysis of the user's emotions, as well as modern systems.

The highlight of this lecture was that these aforementioned people could predict the future of interactive design and how we see it. One fact that I noticed, which surprised me very much, is that Professors Samuel Huron did not mention Douglas Engelbart, as the only creator of the computer mouse. His contribution to interactive design goes far beyond creating the necessary part for every personal computer.

The lecture was also interesting due to the fact that the necessary resources were shown (photo and image);

How could future technologies have been predicted? What were these people thinking for the first time when they created these technologies? How to predict what will cause need and demand and how to translate this into a project?

Such questions appeared in this lecture and I hope to get answers to them soon.
