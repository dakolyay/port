### Ultimate display

In order to understand the essence of [the article](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/summary?doi=10.1.1.136.3720) Ivan E. Sutherland wrote, we must first get to know the author of the article. He was a computer scientist, one of the first people to apply OOP ideas to programming, he is the founder of graphic design, and he is also a father of [the Sketchpad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sketchpad), but most importantly he was a _visionary_. Writing his short but very inspiring article in 1965, he shared his visions and dreams for the computer displays we are so used to working with. In the article, he discusses the magical (but maybe even almost real) possibilities of displays and the different types of interactions these displays have with people, where we could transmit information not only through the muscles in our hands and arms. Indeed, it's not hard to agree with the author that we can miss out on a huge amount of information that our body transmits, be it pupil movement, facial expressions, or intonation of speech.

Although we are moving towards involving other interactions with technology we have not yet arrived at the best version of _Ivan's room_.

> The ultimate display would, of course, be a room within which the computer can control the existence of matter. A chair displayed in such a room would be good enough to sit in. Handcuffs displayed in such a room would be confining, and a bullet displayed in such a room would be fatal. With appropriate programming such a display could literally be the Wonderland into which Alice walked.

But in more than half a century we have made such progress with the introduction of technology into our everyday lives that Alice in Wonderland may soon be more than just a fairy tale for children. If we look at the [Reality-Virtuality Continuum of Milgram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realityâ€“virtuality_continuum) shown below and try to place Ivan's concept where it belongs to.

The author believes that eventually, the display will become a room that will simulate reality for us. If we read the article carefully we can understand how the author is talking about a reality that is complemented by virtuality, where this virality becomes reality. For example, his _room_ where we can routinely exist could create a chair, but we could sit in that chair. The best example is bullets. We could be in a perfectly safe room, but with virtual bullets that could do real damage. I think that I can't find a proper place for Ivan's idea in the continuum and it seems to me this phenomenon kind of surrounds that continuum by bridging between augmented reality and augmented virtuality and can exist in those two points simultaneously.
