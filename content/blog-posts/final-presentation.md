For the final class of this course, we have to present the locomotion technique that we have done. As well we needed to explain the implementation process. Moreover, we presented the results and evaluation process that we have done by using our locomotion technique in the [Parkour](https://github.com/wenjietseng/VR-locomotion-parkour). 

The main idea behind my locomotion technique was to make the most nature-intuitive version of the driving experience. The main features that I was focused on were the accuracy and time spent on completing the parkour.

There is a shortlist of the implementation process. You can find a more detailed explanation in [one of the blog posts](https://dariyamhciblog.netlify.app/blog-posts/teach-me-how-to-drive/). ![](/images/2022-02-24-19-05-43.png)

If we describe the data, we can assume several interesting things such as:![](/images/2022-02-24-19-05-56.png)One of the participants could manage to use the locomotion technique 5 times in one row, which is the highest number of rounds among all the locomotion techniques.

People feel involved in the technique because there is not a lot of disturbing objects during the parkour.

After the presentation, during the discussion among teachers, visitors and students there were some comments according to the locomotion technique. Like, there is a logical reason for high simulation sickness feeling because the technique provides both acceleration and speed reduction. The possible proposed solution to reduce the sickness is to implement a static figure in the frame so users will have to keep in mind it.
