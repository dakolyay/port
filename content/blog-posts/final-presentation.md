There is a shortlist of the implementation process. You can find a more detailed explanation in [one of the blog posts](https://dariyamhciblog.netlify.app/blog-posts/teach-me-how-to-drive/). ![](/images/2022-02-24-19-05-43.png)

If we describe the data, we can assume several interesting things such as:![](/images/2022-02-24-19-05-56.png)One of the participants could manage to use the locomotion technique 5 times in one row, which is the highest number of rounds among all the locomotion techniques.

People feel involved in the technique because there is not a lot of disturbing objects during the parkour.

After the presentation, during the discussion among teachers, visitors and students there were some comments according to the locomotion technique. Like, there is a logical reason for high simulation sickness feeling because the technique provides both acceleration and speed reduction. The possible proposed solution to reduce the sickness is to implement a static figure in the frame so users will have to keep in mind it.
