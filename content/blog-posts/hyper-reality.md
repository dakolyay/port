### Hyperreality

Have you ever wondered what reality will look like with the rapid use of technology? How we will be living in a few decades? If so, we could see [**one variation**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YJg02ivYzSs) of such an idea thanks to a YouTube video. You can see how different information just jumps out at you without giving you a chance to look at reality.

Maybe this will be our world in the future and we could get used to it, but this kind of mixed reality causes some fear.

Imagine living in a world where information is the most valuable currency and your personal life and data about you can be leaked. All your memories, mishaps, preferences, attitudes, fears, relationships with others, all your thoughts and ideas, and just things you would not want to share with the world could be in the public domain. You will lose faith in some people, privacy, everyone will know more about you than yourself. You are an open book to everyone if you get hacked. And whoever looks at you will see your profile in real-time. Sound scary? This could be one possible issue with hyperreality.

Imagine the next situation: Let's say a pop-up window appears when you look at something. In that window, all the descriptive information you need is written, and the secondary information can be accessed just by pressing the "show more" button.

For example, you look at a car, change its color in your mind to red and another person steals it because they think it's their red Tesla car. Then the world would turn into chaos. In such a mixed reality world we would lose reality itself. You can not only have access to someone else's data and to someone else's _world_ but also have the power to change it. Human beings know this world because of a long process of exploring everything around them. They collected important information to keep themselves alive. And now if someone can affect it and try to modify it somehow, life can be in danger.
