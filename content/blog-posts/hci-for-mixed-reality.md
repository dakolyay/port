Overview:

This blog was made to follow the ideas, thought and reactions that I am having while passing the course Human-Computer Interaction for Mixed Reality 2021-2022 in Institut Polytechnique de Paris. Here you will find out the step by step solution for laboratory works, my points of view and conclusions regarding each lecture I have attended, as well as the progress made for the final locomotion project in Unity 3D.
