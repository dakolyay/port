Technique evaluation.

In this section we will look at assessing movement techniques. In total, the evaluation will involve myself and two other test takers. 

The process of evaluating a technique is very important, because we can see how well or poorly it has done, and whether it meets the needs of the people who will be using it. In total, we will be assessing the technique in 6 different ways. The first three traits will be displayed while you are doing the parkour, the next three by taking. All the data has been carefully recorded here. Now for each of the traits:

The average parkour pass time of all attempts by all subjects is equal. In fact, thanks to acceleration, it is possible to finish the whole parkour quite quickly. 

The average parkour accuracy of all attempts of all subjects is equal. The accuracy is calculated from the coins that can be collected during the parkour. The more accurate the technique, the more coins can be collected. 

The average number of completed rounds or how often you can pass parkour with this technique. It is equal in my case. 

In the following three traits you have to answer the question and determine your level from 1 to 10 regarding this trait. 

The feeling of sickness received while using the movement technique was equal, which is not a bad result. Sense of illness is caused by a lack of correlation between the information received from the motor movements and the visual analyser. 

The feeling of being immersed made up. This trait is responsible for how much the user loses touch with the world and gets deeper into what's going on while doing the parkour. 

The rating of fun during the passage. Some movement techniques are designed so that using them brings a kind of interest. This attribute, I believe, correlates with the number of rounds completed. 

In the overall picture, the results were quite pleasing. The technique allows you to pass with great accuracy parkour in a short amount of time without causing side effects from long use, thus increasing the number of attempts to pass the game from start to finish.
