#### Locomotion Technique evaluation.

In this section, we will look at the evaluation process of the locomotion technique. In total, the evaluation will involve me and two other test-takers.

The process of evaluating a technique is very important, because we can see how well or poorly it has been done, and whether it meets the needs of the people who will be using it. In total, we will be evaluating the technique in 6 different features. The first three features will be displayed while you are doing the parkour, the next three by answering the question. Parkour is the environment with different interference where you are able to test your locomotion technique.

All the data has been carefully recorded [**here**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gl_cY8W_fbZ-oWjuwwCaXlhqJYOiIsgjSXGrhmADXK4/edit#gid=0). Now for each of the features:

#### 1.

The average parkour pass time of all attempts by all subjects is equal to 73,99 seconds. It is a nice number thanks to the acceleration because it is possible to finish the whole parkour quite quickly.

#### 2.

The average parkour accuracy of all attempts of all subjects is equal to 0,833. The accuracy is calculated from the coins that can be collected during the parkour. (collected coins/total coins) The more accurate the technique, the more coins can be collected.

#### 3.

The average number of completed rounds or how often you can pass parkour with this technique. It is equal to 3 in my case.

In the following three features you have to answer the question and determine your level from 1 to 10 regarding this feature.

#### 4.

The feeling of sickness received while using the movement technique was equal to 3, which is not a bad result. Sense of illness is caused by a lack of correlation between the information received from the motor movements and the visual analyzer.

#### 5.

The feeling of being immersed is 6. This trait is responsible for how much the user loses touch with the real world and gets deeper into what's going on while doing the parkour.

#### 6.

The rating of fun during the passage is been rated as 7. Some movement techniques are designed so that using them brings a kind of interest. This attribute, I believe, correlates with the number of rounds completed.

In the overall picture, the results were quite pleasing. The technique allows you to pass with great accuracy parkour in a short amount of time without causing side effects from long use, thus increasing the number of attempts to pass the game from start to finish.
